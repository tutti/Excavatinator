+-----------------------------------+
| Changes from version 3 - overview |
+-----------------------------------+
This is version 4 of Excavatinator. Much like previous versions, the major version update represents a significant
rewrite to improve the quality of the addon, as well as the quality of the code. The entire data layer has been
separated out into a separate addon named Excavatinator API, which is open for anyone who wants to use it. The race
information window has been redesigned as well, and now opens below the main frame rather than on its side.

+-------------------------+
| The race details window |
+-------------------------+
The race information window has been completely redesigned. It now prominently shows which race's artifacts are being
shown, and uses icons rather than item names to do so. Artifacts that haven't been completed are shown as grey and
slightly faded, while those that have been completed are fully saturated and opaque. The exclamation mark for pristine
artifacts is now shown in the corner of the icon, while for artifacts with associated achievements the counter is shown
at the bottom of the icon. Both now go away when their respective objective is completed, leaving a fully completed race
appearing with the same style no matter which era it's from.

You can hover your mouse pointer over the artifact's icon to see more information about it, like how many times you have
completed it and its artifact description.

+---------------------+
| The minified window |
+---------------------+
The minified archaeology helper now counts as a separate window, which means you can have both it and the main
Excavatinator window open at the same time. The button to open the minified window is in the same place it used to be.
The solve button has also been improved; instead of only showing up when you have an artifact ready to solve, it now
appears once you acquire a fragment or keystone, and updates to show the progress for the race you most recently got
fragments or keystones for.

+---------------+
| Minimap icons |
+---------------+
Minimap icons are back! Any time you unearth a find, its location will be remembered and marked on your minimap whenever
you're digging in the area. The icons will only appear when you're at the same digsite, so they won't clutter up your
map at other times. The actual tracking is done by the API side, so if you're interested in using the data for your own
purposes in a different addon, you're entirely free to do so.

+---------------------------------+
| Artifact fragment crate vendors |
+---------------------------------+
When buying crates of fragments, the regular Blizzard interface requires you to buy them one at a time, confirming that
you know they can't be refunded. Excavatinator adds the ability to shift+click on a crate in the vendor window to buy
them in bulk. This still takes a few seconds, particularly for large purchases, but is much faster and easier than doing
it manually.

+-----------+
| Bug fixes |
+-----------+
The impetus for once again doing deep work with Excavatinator was a particularly annoying bug in version 3: in many
cases, such as when going through a loading screen or solving an artifact, Blizzard's API would start returning 0 for
the solve count for the current artifact of some or all races, causing Excavatinator to report one point of progression
less than you actually had. A /reload would work around it, but if this annoyed you to look at you might have to do
that somewhat frequently. In version 4 the data layer is much more self sufficient, using Blizzard's API for initial
data and for updates, but keeping its own copy of data otherwise, which seems to have improved this issue significantly
in my personal testing.
