Changes from version 2:
- Several barely useful features have been removed:
	- The skill bar. If you're doing archaeology, chances are you'll spend your time at max skill.
	- The travel frame. Aside from the hearthstone, most travel options are class spells, and you'll be used to using these outside Excavatinator anyway.
	- The item use frame. Archaeology items with on-use effects are generally toys now.
	- The links frame. Links were useful before, but as far as I can tell these differences have mostly been cleaned up by now. If you have a different experience, tell me and I'll work on remaking it.
	- The total completion bar. For me, at least, this was mostly just in the way.
- The main window has had several changes:
	- The race texture is displayed next to its name.
	- The list is now paginated, races are split by the expansion that introduced them.
	- Solving an artifact is no longer done by right clicking, but rather by clicking the artifact icon which will light up when you can solve an artifact.
	- The crate icon can now be clicked to crate an artifact, if you have any.
	- Using keystones for solves is now optional. This feature is now disabled by default.
	- Pristine artifacts are now counted as racial artifacts, and are required for race completion.
	- The Survey button is much bigger, befitting its status as the main ability of Archaeology.
	- Various tooltips have had their Rainbow Road factor removed.
- Collapsing Excavatinator now works completely differently:
	- The old version would simply hide the races that were not available on the current continent and shrink the window to fit.
	- The new version collapses to a much smaller window, with only the most essential tools: Survey, solve, and crate.
	- The solve button will appear when you have enough fragments to solve an artifact of a race, and can be clicked to solve that artifact.
- The artifact list is no longer split into rare, common and pristine artifacts. Instead, the list is now a single list of artifacts.
	- Rare artifacts still appear above common artifacts.
	- Pristine artifacts are no longer listed separately; these now appear as a quest exclamation mark next to the common artifact if incomplete, or a check mark if completed.
	- If an artifact has an associated achievement for collecting some number of that artifact, this is now displayed as a completion bar in the artifact list. This feature replaces the achievement frame.

Fixes from version 3:
- There was a bug that kept the addon from creating its saved variable for new users. This has now been fixed.
- Opening the addon for the first time in a session now presents a short-time loading screen. This is to get around Blizzard's item cache throttling.

Work in progress/features not implemented in this version
- Minimap tracking. I want to remove the dependency on the library I used for this, so I need to research how to do this myself.
